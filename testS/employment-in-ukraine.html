							<p>This guarantee also applies to the right for work of foreigners and stateless persons.</p>
							<p>In order to work, a foreigner shall speak Ukrainian or Russian, because these languages ​​are widely used in Ukraine, and Ukrainian is the state and official language in Ukraine.</p>
							<p>Knowledge of other languages, in particular English, will be an advantage for you before other applicants for a vacancy, as for some professions and activities of companies knowledge of English can be provided as a mandatory condition for participation in the selection to take a vacant position.</p>

							<p>The Law of Ukraine “On Employment of Population” stipulates that employers have the right to use the work of foreigners and stateless persons under the terms of an employment agreement only if the Public Employment Service has issued to the employer a permit to use the work of foreigners and stateless persons, unless otherwise provided by international treaties with Ukraine.</p>

							</ul>
							<p>Involvement of highly skilled foreign specialists and workers, who are necessary for the national economy, is carried out on the grounds determined by the Law of Ukraine "On Immigration".</p>
							<p>The registration of documents, necessary for obtaining a permit for the employment of foreigners, is carried out by the employer who invites a foreigner to work.</p>
							<p>This permit gives the employer the right to temporarily use of work of a particular foreigner at a particular workplace or position.</p>
							<p>The permit for the use of labour is fixed-term, issued for a period from 6 months to 3 years, which depends on the duration of agreement with the employer.</p>
							<p>There is also a fee for obtaining a work permit from 2 to 6 living wages for able-bodied persons.</p>
							<p>The payment is made by the employer.</p>
							<p id="permit">After the expiration of permit, it can be extended indefinitely if the person continues to work.</p>
